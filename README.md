# ImageCaptionGenerator

- Developed an Image Caption Generator Project on Flickr8k dataset
- Image features and training captions sequence features were used map and learn more about the image
- Created a Custom model using LSTM model for prediction (Encoder + Decoder Model) + VGG16 for image feature extraction and achieved a fairly great accuracy for predicting captions on test data
- Used Natural Language Processing Concepts which include tokenization , vectorization and feature extraction for the model creation and prediciton
- Tech : Python , Numpy , Pandas , tensorflow , Flickr8k , LSTM , VGG16
